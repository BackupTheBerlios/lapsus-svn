0.0.3
=====
 * Heavily rewritten to support hardware using backends  (possibly various,
   so far only Asus backend is present) and per method arguments.
 * Reduced the number of methods and changed the interface to support any
   feature values, so both LEDs, switches, backlight, etc. can be used using
   one method. Each feature can have a list of legal values instead of
   simple true/false. Will be needed for IBMs with on/off/blinking LEDs ;)
 * KDE Panel Applet now has feature detection, uses FlowLayout and creates
   backlight slider, panel icons, as well as context menu switches with LEDs.
 * Some more artwork. "Art". I am not an artist ;)
 * New code for icon loading and scaling


0.0.2
=====
 * Daemon rewritten for Qt3 with dbus-qt4-qt3backport
 * KDE Panel Applet with backlight/switches controls.


0.0.1
=====
 * Initial release - "test" release which used Qt4.
