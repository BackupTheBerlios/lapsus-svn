0.0.6
=====
* Asus backend:
 - Lapsusd should now properly recognise new LED's names (new version
    of the asus-laptop driver creates 'asus::ledname' instead of
    'asus:ledname'. Lapsusd should now properly work in both cases.
* IBM backend:
 - supports volume mute switch
 - ACPI events and notifications are not generated if the NVRAM change was
    because of dbus feature write
 - features will be updated when NVRAM state is modified, unless there is
    no NVRAM device opened
* Alsa mixer:
 - Now mixer has always 0-100 volume range
 - Volume level reported is the same as it was set, even if due to rounding
    errors it not really is - user gets nice, round values when using hotkeys
 - Now both headphone and the best channel found is set
    to given volume/mute status
* Applet modifications:
 - Mute/volume status is now properly updated after widgets are recreated
    when the configuration settings are accepted
 - Added touchpad icon made by RÃ©my Dupont - Thanks!
 - Added German translation (thanks to Johannes Engel).
* Other changes:
 - added missing 'stdlib.h' include in sys_ibm - new version of gcc
    needs that for malloc, free, etc.
 - updated KDE's admin and Makefile.cvs to newer versions
 - updated dbus-qt4-qt3backport to the current svn version

0.0.5
=====
 Daemon:
 * Added brightness up Asus hotkey support.
 * Added LightSensor support.
 * Changed feature ID system to be multilevel (asus.feature, alsa.feature etc.)
 * Hardware backends are in separate modules now - for example AlsaMixer is
    separate module, with its own DBus interface - instead of used as a part
    of Asus backend, or any other backend that needs Alsa support. Similar
    is with synaptics backend.
 * Added Unix signal handling - now lapsusd can quit gracefully when it
    receives SIGTERM or SIGINT in no-daemon mode - so it can close DBus,
    and save its configuration.
 * Added lapsusd state - in /var/lib/lapsusd/lapsusdrc file it can keep
    various options.
 * Added Autosave module, for saving feature values when lapsusd quits
    and restoing them when it starts.
 * Added config module. Any backend might have its own configuration values
    kept in state file - not used by the GUI yet.
 * Various minor fixes and improvements.

 Applet:
 * Added mute/unmute switching with middle mouse button on volume slider.
 * Added 'About' dialog.
 * Added 'Bugs' dialog.
 * Added 'Configuration' dialog.
 * Added management of menu and panel entries.
 * Added OSD customization.
 * Added Autosave configuration.
 * Various fixes and improvements.

0.0.4
=====
 Daemon:
 * Added generic backend, if no known hardware is detected it is used
    and provides basic support - for now for synaptics touchpads and alsa
    mixer.
 * Added support for Alsa Mixer - used by Asus and Generic backends.
 * Added experimental IBM backend with basic features supported
 * Added support for Synaptics synclient to control touchpad state on/off.
    Generic and Asus backend use it. IBM backend doesn't have support
    for touchpad yet, but probably will use NVRAM method.
 * Added NVRAM support to IBM backend - basen on ThinkPad Buttons project
 * IBM backend uses volume control and backlight control buttons support
    provided by NVRAM.
 * Added support for volume control, backlight control and touchpad control
    buttons to Asus backend.
 * Added notification signals - sent together with feature-change signals,
    but used to indicate change which occured because of external events,
    like NVRAM, or hotkeys.

 Applet:
 * Changed the method for creating icons' text - no image for each letter
    needed. Any letters are added to icons using drawText.
 * Improved icon management code in action/panel button classes. Any arguments
    can have icons (not only on/off/blink), if only recognised by lapsus_icons
    class.
 * Added OSD - based on K3b job-progress OSD.
 * Added touchpad support.

0.0.3
=====
 * Heavily rewritten to support hardware using backends  (possibly various,
   so far only Asus backend is present) and per method arguments.
 * Reduced the number of methods and changed the interface to support any
   feature values, so both LEDs, switches, backlight, etc. can be used using
   one method. Each feature can have a list of legal values instead of
   simple true/false. Will be needed for IBMs with on/off/blinking LEDs ;)
 * KDE Panel Applet now has feature detection, uses FlowLayout and creates
   backlight slider, panel icons, as well as context menu switches with LEDs.
 * Some more artwork. "Art". I am not an artist ;)
 * New code for icon loading and scaling


0.0.2
=====
 * Daemon rewritten for Qt3 with dbus-qt4-qt3backport
 * KDE Panel Applet with backlight/switches controls.


0.0.1
=====
 * Initial release - "test" release which used Qt4.
