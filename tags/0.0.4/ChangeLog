0.0.4
=====
 Daemon:
 * Added generic backend, if no known hardware is detected it is used
    and provides basic support - for now for synaptics touchpads and alsa
    mixer.
 * Added support for Alsa Mixer - used by Asus and Generic backends.
 * Added experimental IBM backend with basic features supported
 * Added support for Synaptics synclient to control touchpad state on/off.
    Generic and Asus backend use it. IBM backend doesn't have support
    for touchpad yet, but probably will use NVRAM method.
 * Added NVRAM support to IBM backend - basen on ThinkPad Buttons project
 * IBM backend uses volume control and backlight control buttons support
    provided by NVRAM.
 * Added support for volume control, backlight control and touchpad control
    buttons to Asus backend.
 * Added notification signals - sent together with feature-change signals,
    but used to indicate change which occured because of external events,
    like NVRAM, or hotkeys.

 Applet:
 * Changed the method for creating icons' text - no image for each letter
    needed. Any letters are added to icons using drawText.
 * Improved icon management code in action/panel button classes. Any arguments
    can have icons (not only on/off/blink), if only recognised by lapsus_icons
    class.
 * Added OSD - based on K3b job-progress OSD.
 * Added touchpad support.

0.0.3
=====
 * Heavily rewritten to support hardware using backends  (possibly various,
   so far only Asus backend is present) and per method arguments.
 * Reduced the number of methods and changed the interface to support any
   feature values, so both LEDs, switches, backlight, etc. can be used using
   one method. Each feature can have a list of legal values instead of
   simple true/false. Will be needed for IBMs with on/off/blinking LEDs ;)
 * KDE Panel Applet now has feature detection, uses FlowLayout and creates
   backlight slider, panel icons, as well as context menu switches with LEDs.
 * Some more artwork. "Art". I am not an artist ;)
 * New code for icon loading and scaling


0.0.2
=====
 * Daemon rewritten for Qt3 with dbus-qt4-qt3backport
 * KDE Panel Applet with backlight/switches controls.


0.0.1
=====
 * Initial release - "test" release which used Qt4.
