Notes
=====


Lapsus is a program created to let ASUS laptops users use all the features
of their laptops which are supported by asus-laptop module from acpi4asus
project (http://acpi4asus.sourceforge.net).

It consist of daemon program, which runs with root priviliges and reads
and writes to files created by asus-laptop in /sys/ directory, monitors ACPI
events and (in the future) controls cpufreq utils.

The other part is a KDE Panel Applet, which is similar to KMix Applet (even
the code was stolen ;) ) and lets to change LCD backlight power similar to the
way KMix Applet lets to change sound volume, and control switch values which
are supported by lapsusd (LEDs, bluetooth, wifi...).

(lapsusd can also be controlled without lapsus program - see 'LapsusD' below)

Sometime int the future there will be standalone client with the similar
functions as the applet. As for now, there is only applet with very limited
functions set - it lets to change LED values, switch on/off wirelles and
bluetooth and change backlight power of ASUS laptops.

I plan to add more features, like display switching, binding
hotkeys ("multimedia" keys supported by ACPI) to programs
and actions, add OSD information when changing volume/backlight/etc
(similar to OSD provided by ASUS programs in Windows) and possibility
to control cpufreq utils from the tray. It should also monitor
battery status and change 'power profiles' (with cpufreq) depending
on power status. I know there is KDE program which does that,
but I would like lapsus to be all-in-one ASUS laptop utility.

It should, probably, be possible to add other laptop brands  very easily,
but unless there is someone with different type of hardware who would like
to help, it will be ASUS only utility.

It was created as a Qt4 program, and then ported to Qt3 with
dbus-qt4-qt3backport (included in the source tree od lapsus).



LapsusD
-------

It is possible to use lapsusd and control it without lapsus program/applet but
with dbus-send command.

dbus-send --print-reply --system --dest=de.berlios.Lapsus /LapsusDaemon \
de.berlios.Lapsus.* arguments

Where * is a command of lapsusd, and arguments are command specific.

For example, to switch Touchpad LED on you can use this command:

dbus-send --print-reply --system --dest=de.berlios.Lapsus /LapsusDaemon \
de.berlios.Lapsus.setSwitch string:'Touchpad LED' boolean:true

To switch it off use boolean:false.

Possible values for setSwitch depend on the list of devices detected by
asus-laptop module, but Wireless, Bluetooth, Mail LED and Touchpad LED
should be available on most machines. You can get the list of available
switches with:

dbus-send --print-reply --system --dest=de.berlios.Lapsus /LapsusDaemon \
de.berlios.Lapsus.listSwitches

For each switch you can set the value with setSwitch, but also check the value
with getSwitch method:

dbus-send --print-reply --system --dest=de.berlios.Lapsus /LapsusDaemon \
de.berlios.Lapsus.getSwitch string:'Mail LED'

There are also other thins lapsusd can do. List of features can be obtained
with listFeatures method.

For more methods and their arguments see global/lapsus.xml file.

dbus-send can be used together with one (or even more) lapsus programs
running at the same time - everything should work just fine :)
